 Files

chord_train.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook containing code
chord_metadata.csv - file with chord data for training
training - zipped folder containing training data
 

To get started:
1. Move project folder chord_trainer into your main Google Drive directory (make sure training folder is unzipped). 
2. Open the notebook chord_train.ipynb in Google Colab.
3. Enable GPU runtime.
4. Run all cells (may be prompted to give Colab drive access)
