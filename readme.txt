This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify audio clips of musical chords as major or minor, based on their spectrograms.

To get started:
1. Move project folder chord_trainer into your main Google Drive directory.
2. Open the notebook chord_train.ipynb in Google Colab.
3. Enable GPU runtime.
4. Run all cells (may be prompted to give Colab drive access)
